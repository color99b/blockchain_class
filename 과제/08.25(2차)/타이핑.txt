My name is Nick Jones. I help people translate ideas from words and visuals into prototypes and websites using code. I love doing that. Family is my priority so I work from home on things I can be proud to share with them. I design, prototype and code interfaces from Hillsborough, NC for clients mostly elsewhere. For larger projects, I collaborate with a tight knit team of elite operatives.
